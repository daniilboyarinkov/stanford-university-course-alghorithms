# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You know what?

I'm taking part in open stanford university course of algorithms. 

There dear Mr. Roughgarden [(Tim Roughgarden)](http://timroughgarden.org/) teaches people about algorithms.

Also, he gives pseudocode realization of these algorithms.

So, main aim that repo is the practice of mine in understanding these pretty tricky algos.

P.S.  
I use TypeScript for algos realization.
